I’m proud to announce the launch of Qumva Network, a decentralized social media platform powered by Web3! As the sole developer behind this project, I’ve built the entire website from the ground up, leveraging modern technologies to create a secure, transparent, and user-focused experience. <br>
Key features I developed <br>
🔗 Web3 Wallet Connect <br>
🔐 Google, Email, Twitter Authentication <br>
💰 Coin Transfer System <br>
🎯 Referral System <br>
✅ Task Completion System <br>
🔑 OTP Verification <br>
🎨 Animations with Framer Motion <br>
🛠️ Admin Dashboard <br>
<br>
<br>
For this project, I used React, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Firebase on the frontend, and Node, Express, Nodemailer, MongoDB on the backend. The platform is already handling over 4,000 users per day! 🎉
It’s been a challenging but rewarding experience, and I’m excited to see Qumva grow!
